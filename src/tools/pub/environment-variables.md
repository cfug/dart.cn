Environment variables allow you to customize pub to suit your needs.

`PUB_CACHE`
: Some of pub's dependencies are downloaded to the pub cache.
  By default, this directory is located under `.pub-cache`
  in your home directory (on macOS and Linux),
  or in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache` (on Windows). (The precise location of the
  cache may vary depending on the Windows version.)
  You can use the `PUB_CACHE` environment
  variable to specify another location. For more information, see
  [The system package cache](/tools/pub/cmd/pub-get#the-system-package-cache).

`PUB_HOSTED_URL`
: Pub downloads dependencies from the [pub.dev site.]({{site.pub}})
  To specify the location of a particular mirror server,
  use the `PUB_HOSTED_URL` environment variable. For example:

{% prettify sh tag=pre+code %}
PUB_HOSTED_URL = http://user:password@177.0.0.1:9999
{% endprettify %}
